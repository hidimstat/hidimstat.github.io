Support Recovery on fMRI Data
=============================

This example compares methods based on Desparsified Lasso (DL) to estimate
voxel activation maps associated with behavior, specifically decoder map support.
All methods presented here provide statistical guarantees.

To demonstrate these methods, we use the Haxby dataset, focusing on the
'face vs house' contrast. We analyze labeled activation maps from a single subject
to produce a brain map showing the discriminative pattern between these two conditions.

This example illustrates that in high-dimensional settings (many voxels),
DL becomes impractical due to memory constraints. However, we can overcome
this limitation using feature aggregation methods that leverage the spatial structure
of the data (high correlation between neighboring voxels).

We introduce two feature aggregation methods that maintain statistical guarantees,
though with a small spatial tolerance in support detection (i.e., they may identify
null covariates "close" to non-null covariates):

* Clustered Desparsified Lasso (CLuDL): combines clustering (parcellation) with statistical inference
* Ensemble Clustered Desparsified Lasso (EnCluDL): adds randomization to the clustering process

EnCluDL is particularly powerful as it doesn't rely on a single clustering choice.
As demonstrated in :footcite:t:`chevalier2021decoding`, it produces relevant
predictive regions across various tasks.

fetch and preprocess Haxby dataset
----------------------------------------------
We define a function that gathers and preprocesses the Haxby dataset for a given subject.
Only the 'face' and 'house' conditions are kept for this example.

Gathering and preprocessing Haxby dataset for a given subject
-------------------------------------------------------------
The `preprocess_haxby` function make the preprocessing of the Haxby dataset,
it outputs the preprocessed activation maps for the two conditions
'face' or 'house' (contained in `X`), the conditions (in `y`),
the session labels (in `groups`) and the mask (in `masker`).
You may choose a subject in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. By default subject=2.

Due to the very high dimensionality of the problem (close to 40,000 voxels) computing
a p-value map with Desparsified Lasso would be very memory consuming and may also be
inadequate since it does not take into account the spatial structure of the data.

Below, we run the ensemble clustered inference algorithm which adds a
randomization step over the clustered inference algorithm (c.f. References).
To make the example as short as possible we take `n_bootstraps=5`
which means that 5 different parcellations are considered and
then 5 statistical maps are produced and aggregated into one.
However you might benefit from clustering randomization taking
`n_bootstraps=25` or `n_bootstraps=100`, also we set `n_jobs=n_jobs`.

Plotting the results
--------------------
To allow a better visualization of the disciminative pattern we will plot
z-maps rather than p-value maps. Assuming Gaussian distribution of the
estimators we can recover a z-score from a p-value by using the
inverse survival function.

First, we set theoretical FWER target at 10%.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 207-214

    n_samples, n_features = X.shape

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-219

Now, we can plot the thresholded z-score maps by translating the
p-value maps estimated previously into z-score maps and using the
suitable threshold. For a better readability, we make a small function
called `plot_map` that wraps all these steps.

Analysis of the results
-----------------------
As advocated in introduction, the methods that do not reduce the original
problem are not satisfying since they are too conservative.
Among those methods, the only one that makes discoveries is the one that
threshold the SVR decoder using a parametric approximation.
However this method has no statistical guarantees and we can see that some
isolated voxels are discovered, which seems quite spurious.
The discriminative pattern derived from the clustered inference algorithm
(CluDL) show that the method is less conservative.
However, some reasonable patterns are also included in this solution.
Finally, the solution provided by the ensemble clustered inference algorithm
(EnCluDL) seems realistic as we recover the visual cortex and do not make
spurious discoveries.
