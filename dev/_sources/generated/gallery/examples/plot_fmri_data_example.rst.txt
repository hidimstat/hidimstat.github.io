Support Recovery on fMRI Data
=============================

This example compares methods based on Desparsified Lasso (DL) to estimate
voxel activation maps associated with behavior, specifically decoder map support.
All methods presented here provide statistical guarantees.

To demonstrate these methods, we use the Haxby dataset, focusing on the
'face vs house' contrast. We analyze labeled activation maps from a single subject
to produce a brain map showing the discriminative pattern between these two conditions.

This example illustrates that in high-dimensional settings (many voxels),
DL becomes impractical due to memory constraints. However, we can overcome
this limitation using feature aggregation methods that leverage the spatial structure
of the data (high correlation between neighboring voxels).

We introduce two feature aggregation methods that maintain statistical guarantees,
though with a small spatial tolerance in support detection (i.e., they may identify
null covariates "close" to non-null covariates):

* Clustered Desparsified Lasso (CLuDL): combines clustering (parcellation)
    with statistical inference
* Ensemble Clustered Desparsified Lasso (EnCluDL): adds randomization
    to the clustering process

EnCluDL is particularly powerful as it doesn't rely on a single clustering choice.
As demonstrated in :footcite:t:`chevalier2021decoding`, it produces relevant
predictive regions across various tasks.

Gathering and preprocessing Haxby dataset for a given subject

The `preprocess_haxby` function make the preprocessing of the Haxby dataset,
it outputs the preprocessed activation maps for the two conditions
'face' or 'house' (contained in `X`), the conditions (in `y`),
the session labels (in `groups`) and the mask (in `masker`).
You may choose a subject in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. By default subject=2.

Making the inference with several algorithms
--------------------------------------------

First, we try to recover the discriminative pattern by computing
p-values from desparsified lasso.
Due to the size of the X, it's not possible to use this method with a limit
of 5 G for memory. To handle this problem, the following methods use some
feature aggregation methods.

Below, we run the ensemble clustered inference algorithm which adds a
randomization step over the clustered inference algorithm (c.f. References).
To make the example as short as possible we take `n_bootstraps=5`
which means that 5 different parcellations are considered and
then 5 statistical maps are produced and aggregated into one.
However you might benefit from clustering randomization taking
`n_bootstraps=25` or `n_bootstraps=100`, also we set `n_jobs`.

Plotting the results
--------------------
To allow a better visualization of the disciminative pattern we will plot
z-maps rather than p-value maps. Assuming Gaussian distribution of the
estimators we can recover a z-score from a p-value by using the
inverse survival function.

First, we set theoretical FWER target at 10%.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 218-222

.. code-block:: Python


    n_samples, n_features = X.shape
    target_fwer = 0.1








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 223-226

We now translate the FWER target into a z-score target.
For the permutation test methods we do not need any additional correction
since the p-values are already adjusted for multiple testing.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 226-229

.. code-block:: Python


    zscore_threshold_corr = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 230-233

Other methods need to be corrected. We consider the Bonferroni correction.
For methods that do not reduce the feature space, the correction
consists in dividing by the number of features.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 233-237

.. code-block:: Python


    correction = 1.0 / n_features
    zscore_threshold_no_clust = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2) * correction)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 238-240

For methods that parcelates the brain into groups of voxels, the correction
consists in dividing by the number of parcels (or clusters).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 240-244

.. code-block:: Python


    correction_clust = 1.0 / n_clusters
    zscore_threshold_clust = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2) * correction_clust)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 245-249

Now, we can plot the thresholded z-score maps by translating the
p-value maps estimated previously into z-score maps and using the
suitable threshold. For a better readability, we make a small function
called `plot_map` that wraps all these steps.

Analysis of the results
-----------------------
As advocated in introduction, the methods that do not reduce the original
problem are not satisfying since they are too conservative.
Among those methods, the only one that makes discoveries is the one that
threshold the SVR decoder using a parametric approximation.
However this method has no statistical guarantees and we can see that some
isolated voxels are discovered, which seems quite spurious.
The discriminative pattern derived from the clustered inference algorithm
(CluDL) show that the method is less conservative.
However, some reasonable patterns are also included in this solution.
Finally, the solution provided by the ensemble clustered inference algorithm
(EnCluDL) seems realistic as we recover the visual cortex and do not make
spurious discoveries.
