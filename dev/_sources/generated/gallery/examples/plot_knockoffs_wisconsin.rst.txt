Controlled multiple variable selection on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
=============================================================================

In this example, we explore the basics of variable selection and illustrate the need to
statistically control the amount of faslely selected variables. We compare two variable
selection methods: the Lasso and the Model-X Knockoffs :footcite:t:`candes2018panning`.
We show how the Lasso is not robust to the presence of irrelevant variables, while the
Knockoffs (KO) method is able to address this issue.

Load the breast cancer dataset
------------------------------------------------------
There are 569 samples and 30 features that correspond to tumor attributes.
The downstream task is to classify tumors as benign or malignant. We leave out 10% of
the data to evaluate the performance of the Logistic Lasso (Logistic Regression with
L1 regularization) on the prediction task.

Selecting variables with the Logistic Lasso
-----------------------------------------------------------
We want to select variables that are relevant to the outcome, i.e. tumor
charateristics that are associated with tumor malignance. We start off by applying a
classical method using Lasso logistic regression and retaining variables with non-null
coefficients:

    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV

    clf = LogisticRegressionCV(
        Cs=np.logspace(-3, 3, 10), penalty="l1", solver="liblinear", random_state=rng
    )
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"Accuracy of Lasso on test set: {clf.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")


    selected_lasso = np.where(np.abs(clf.coef_[0]) > 1e-6)[0]
    print(f"The Lasso selects {len(selected_lasso)} variables:")
    print(f"{'Variable name':<30} | {'Coefficient':>10}")
    print("-" * 45)
    for i in selected_lasso:
        print(f"{feature_names[i]:<30} | {clf.coef_[0][i]:>10.3f}")

    mean concave points            |     -0.438

Evaluating the rejection set
------------------------------------------
Since we do not have the ground truth for the selected variables (i.e. we do not know
the relationship between the tumor characteristics and the the malignance of the tumor
), we cannot evaluate this selection set directly. To investigate the reliability of
this method, we artificially increase the number of variables by adding noisy copies
of the features. These are correlated with the variables in the dataset, but are not
related to the outcome.

There are 180 features, 30 of them are real and 150 of them are fake and independent
of the outcome. We now apply the Lasso (with cross-validation to select the best
regularization parameter) to the noisy dataset and observe the results:

        np.array(selected_mask[p:]) == "selected"
    )  # Count the number of selected spurious variables

The Lasso selects many spurious variables that are not directly related to the outcome.
To mitigate this problem, we can use one of the statistically controlled variable
selection methods implemented in hidimstat. This ensures that the proportion of False
Discoveries is below a certain bound set by the user in all scenarios.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-142

Controlled variable selection with Knockoffs
----------------------------------------------------
We use the Model-X Knockoff procedure to control the FDR (False Discovery Rate). The
selection of variables is based on the Lasso Coefficient Difference (LCD) statistic
:footcite:t:`candes2018panning`.

Visualizing the results
----------------------------------------------------
We can compare the selection sets obtained by the two methods. In addition to the
binary selection (selected or not), we can also visualize the the KO statistic
along with the selection threshold for the knockoffs and the absolute value of the
Lasso coefficients. We plot the 25 most important features according to the KO
statistic.

We can clearly see that the knockoffs procedure is more conservative than the Lasso
and rejects the spurious features while many of them are selected by the Lasso. It is
also interesting to note that some of the selected variables (with the high KO
statistic (e.g., worst radius, worst area, mean concave points) are also variables
with the largest Lasso coefficients.
