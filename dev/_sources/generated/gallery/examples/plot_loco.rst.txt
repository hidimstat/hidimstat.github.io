Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) feature importance with different regression models
==================================================================================

This example demonstrates how to compare LOCO feature importance [:footcite:t:`Williamson_General_2023`] across different
predictive models on the same regression dataset. LOCO is model-agnostic and can be
applied to any predictive model. Here, we use a linear model, a random forest, a neural
network, and a support vector machine. We compare the models based on their predictive
performance (R2 score) and the LOCO feature importance they yield.

Loading and preparing the data
------------------------------
We begin by simulating a regression dataset with 10 features, 5 of which
are in the support set, meaning they contribute to generating the outcome. In this example,
we use a simulated dataset to have access to the true support set of features and
evaluate how well the different models identify these important features.
The data is then split into training and test sets. These sets are used both to fit
the predictive models and within the LOCO procedure, which refits models on subsets
of features that exclude the feature of interest.

Fitting models and computing LOCO feature importance
----------------------------------------------------
We define a list of predictive models to compare. We use RidgeCV for linear
regression, RandomForestRegressor for a tree-based model, MLPRegressor for a
neural network, and SVR for a support vector machine, with RBF kernel. We then fit
each model on the training data, compute the LOCO feature importance on the test
data, and store the results in a DataFrame for comparison.

The predictive performance of the models can be compared using their R2 scores.
This helps assess how effectively each model captures the underlying data-generating
process.

Visualization of LOCO feature importance
----------------------------------------
Finally, we visualize the LOCO feature importance for each model using a horizontal
bar plot. The true support features are highlighted in the plot with a green shaded
background.

The plot shows that the different models all identify the true support features and
assign them higher importance scores. However, the magnitude of the importance scores
varies across models. It can be observed that models with a greater predictive
performance (higher R2 score) tend to assign higher importance scores to the true
support features.
